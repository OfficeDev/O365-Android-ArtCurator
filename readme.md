Art Curator is a sample application that demonstrates some of the core functionality of the Office 365 APIs, including Authentication (using ADAL) Mail API. Art Curator is essentially a richer code sample that also solves a real world problem and is visually appealing.

The scenario involves a small business owner with an art-based business, such as an online tee shirt company. The business owner receives hundreds of emails a week with potential new designs from designers all over the world. Using his Office 365 account, he can sign in to Art Curator to respond to emails more quickly and efficiently.
